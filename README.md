# 🔒 Password Generator
Password Generator is a simple Java console app that creates secure, customizable passwords using letters, digits, and special characters. It’s fast, easy to use, and great for learning core Java concepts! 🚀

## 📚 Project Overview
This is a simple **Password Generator** written in Java. It allows users to generate secure passwords of customizable length, using a mix of:

- ✅ Uppercase letters (A-Z)
- ✅ Lowercase letters (a-z)
- ✅ Digits (0-9)
- ✅ Special characters (!@#$%^&*()-_=+<>?)

The project demonstrates the use of Java concepts like:
- **Random class** for generating random characters
- **StringBuilder** for password construction
- **Scanner** for user input
